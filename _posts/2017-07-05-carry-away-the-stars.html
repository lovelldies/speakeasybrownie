<p>I can’t wait for the hours to dissolve the day<br>
I can’t wait to hear all that you are gonna say</p>
 
<p>Pleasantly so surprising<br>
To see just how far we’ve come together<br>
You’ve got me living my dreams in my memories</p>

<p class="chorus">Carry away the stars<br>
Pocket the moon, let’s make them ours<br>
Ride away on the breeze<br>
Savour the moments like these!</p>
 
<p>Never thought I’d have so much to look forward to<br>
Never thought every day would teach me something new</p>
 
<p>Pleasantly so surprising<br>
To see just how far we’ve come together<br>
You’ve got me living my dreams in my memories</p>

<p class="chorus">Carry away the stars<br>
Pocket the moon, let’s make them ours<br>
Ride away on the breeze<br>
Savour the moments like these!</p>
 

<p class="chorus"><em>Bridge:</em><br>
Day after day, night after night<br>
Cradle our love, keep it alight<br>
The fire you birthed is now burning in me<br>
A flame for eternity</p>
