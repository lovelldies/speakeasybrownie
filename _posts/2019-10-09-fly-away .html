<p>I need to break<br>
  The mould that makes<br>
  Me hoard my pain<br>
  For selfish gain<br>
  To see you squirm<br>
  Take you to task<br>
  Justified revenge<br>
  Doesn't need a mask</p>

<p>So, I'll begin<br>
  By reeling in<br>
  The wasted years<br>
  And trading in<br>
  My memories<br>
  Archenemies<br>
  Of all the things<br>
  You want to hear me say</p>

<p class="chorus">Fly away<br>
  When forgiveness flies<br>
  High above our past</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll begin<br>
  By reeling in<br>
  The wasted years<br>
  And trading in<br>
  My memories<br>
  Archenemies<br>
  Of all the things<br>
  You want to hear me say</p>

<p class="chorus">Fly Away<br>
  When forgiveness flies<br>
  High above our past</p>

<p class="italic">I've heard time will erase every vestige<br>
  I just hope that my heart gets the message<br>
  I'll avoid Schadenfreude tonight<br>
  And set us free</p>

<p>So, go...<br>
  When forgiveness flies<br>
  High above our past</p>

<p class="chorus">Fly Away<br>
  When forgiveness flies<br>
  High above our past</p>
