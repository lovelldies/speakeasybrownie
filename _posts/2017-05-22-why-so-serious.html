title: Why So Serious?

<p>Babe, I'm sorry<br />
I should have never said those things to you<br />
Now do you<br />
want to stay beside me?<br />
Let me just convey my point of view<br />
I'll take 2, babe</p>

<p class="chorus">But, why so serious?<br />
That look is quite insidious<br />
Tell me, is this a silent coup?</p>
<p class="chorus">'Coz I don't think there's ever been<br />
A silence-wielding drama queen<br />
Who has won as many silent wars as you!</p>

<p>I tossed and turned from night 'til morning<br />
Rehearsing what I'd say to you<br />
Flowers, chocolates and a movie?<br />
Babe, 'Transporter 2'?!<br />
But, you won't let me off so easily...<br />
A stab of pain won't do<br />
No, please, not that again<br />
I can't not go...<br />
it's 'boys night' with my crew</p>

<p class="chorus">Baby, why so serious?<br />
That look is quite insidious<br />
Tell me, is this a silent coup?</p>
<p class="chorus">'Coz I don't think there's ever been<br />
A silence-wielding drama queen<br />
Who has won as many silent wars as you!</p>

<p>Blinded by your anger-fog<br />
Stutter-stammer monologue<br />
Please f-f-forgive me.<br />
Say you love me out aloud<br />
Silver lining on this cloud<br />
Ease this storm within me</p>

<p>Yeah, I'm blinded<br />
By your anger-fog<br />
Stutter-stammer monologue<br />
Please forgive me<br />
Say you love me<br />
Say it out aloud<br />
Silver lining on this cloud<br />
Won't you, baby?</p>

<p class="chorus">Baby, why so serious?<br />
Oh, girl, is this is a silent coup?</p>
<p class="chorus">'Coz I don't think there's ever been<br />
A silence-wielding drama queen<br />
Who has won as many silent wars as you!</p>
