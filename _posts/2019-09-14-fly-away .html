<p>I need to break<br>
The mould that makes<br>
Me hoard my pain<br>
For selfish gain<br>
To see you squirm<br>
Before you ask:<br>
“Can we please not let it end this way?”</p>

<p>I’ll begin<br>
By reeling in<br>
The wasted years<br>
And trading in<br>
My Memories<br>
Archenemies<br>
Of all the things<br>
You need to hear me say</p>

<p class="chorus">Fly away<br>
When forgiveness flies<br>
High above our past</p>

<p>I’ll begin<br>
By reeling in<br>
The wasted years <br>
And trading in<br>
My memories<br>
Archenemies<br>
Of all the things
You need to hear me say</p>

<p class="chorus">Fly Away<br>
When forgiveness flies<br>
High above our past</p>
