<p>You’ve fired up the engine of my heart<br>
And I want you<br>
And I want you<br>
I want you beside me</p>

<p class="chorus">We’re on a ride to the end of the world<br>
I’m sure we’ll find love at the end<br>
So, even if you’re still not sure<br>
Don’t make this love train stop </p>

<p>Hey, Lady, let me tell ya<br>
Funk-struck love is out to get ya!

<p>You’ve fired up the engine of my heart<br>
And I want you<br>
And I want you<br>
I want you beside me</p>

<p class="chorus">We’re on a ride to the end of the world<br>
I’m sure we’ll find love at the end<br>
So, even if you’re still not sure<br>
Don’t make this love train stop </p>

<p>Ooooh, yeah!<br>
Let me tell you how this will go down

<p>“Another one bites the dust!”<br>
They’ll say so ‘coz they must<br>
“She’s way out of his league”<br>
Opinions add to the intrigue</p>

<p>I’m as thick-skinned as they come<br>
…And even more, and then some<br>
And the more lovin’ I do<br>
the more I’ll love right into you!</p>

<p class="chorus">scat vocal</p>

<p>Hey, Lady, let me tell ya
Funk-struck love is out to get ya!</p>
