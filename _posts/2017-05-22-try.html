<p>I’ve got to<br>
Try to live humbly<br>
‘Coz Pride is rough and tumble<br>
Power needs no chasing<br>
When I love people over the praising</p>

<p class="chorus">My friend, remind me every day<br>
Of all the things I’m doing OK<br>
And of all of me that needs to leave</p>

<p>I’ve got to<br>
Try to live humbly<br>
Pride is rough and tumble</p>

<p class="chorus">My friend, remind me every day<br>
Of all the things I’m doing OK<br>
And of all of me that needs to leave</p>

<p>Honestly, it worries me<br>
To see how simple words can<br>
Give me such a smug and swollen head</p>

<p>On the contrary, the other ‘me’<br>
Feeds off all the attention <br>
A crazy dance is going on in my head - haha!</p>

<p class="chorus">My friend, remind me every day<br>
Of all the things I’m doing OK<br>
And of all of me that needs to leave</p>
