<p>Defeated, I reach for my victory speech<br>
Rehearsing my joy through all that life has to teach me</p>

<p>Because I know I finally<br>
Know I belong<br>
And every mistake, doesn’t make everything wrong<br>
Oh no!</p>

<p class="chorus">The battles that have not been won<br>
Can never condemn or ever confine<br>
My dreams to the safety of home<br>
My heart’s on a course, my mind’s free to roam</p>

<p class="chorus">Stepping out, moving forward<br>
I’m not giving in!<br>
Getting up, growing stronger<br>
I’m not giving in!</p>
