<p>I love you tonight<br>
Tomorrow I might<br>
Love you even more<br>
That's happened before<br>
Watch the red get deeper...</p>

<p class="chorus">Scarlet in the moonlight<br>
Come and ride with me to unity<br>
Where love withstands it all<br>
Alright, baby now hold tight<br>
I am revving to forever with you!</p>

<p>And I want you to know<br>
I'd never ever have it any other way<br>
Overhauling every dream I cling to<br>
I'll rebuild around you<br>
Yeah!</p>

<p class="chorus">Scarlet in the moonlight<br>
Come and ride with me to unity<br>
Where love withstands it all<br>
Alright, baby now hold tight<br>
I am revving to forever with you!</p>

<p class="chorus">Scarlet...<br>
Ride with me to unity<br>
Where love withstands it all<br>
Alright, baby now hold tight<br>
I am revving to forever with you</p>

<p>[Our love's like scarlet; you're where my heart is]<br>
I wanna keep living, I wanna be loving...<br>
I wanna keep living life with you.</p>
