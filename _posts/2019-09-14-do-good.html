<p>Lately <br>
I’ve been troubled by the rise of evil in this world we live in<br>
Maybe <br>
It’s easier not to do what’s right but I won’t give in<br>
Bathe in love<br>
Spread the light, yeah!</p>

<p class="chorus">And I say...<br>
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do<br>
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do<br>
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do<br>
Do good!</p>

<p>The stars above<br>
shine down upon us all tonight, yeah<br>
Bracing for<br>
The legacies we’re leaving now<br>
Bathe in love<br>
Spread the light, yeah!</p>

<p class="chorus">And I say...<br>
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do<br>
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do<br>
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do<br>
Do good!</p>

<p>I sink my feet<br>
Into the earth and<br>
I can feel her heartbeat<br>
The confluence of<br>
The world’s stories<br>
Is where our souls meet</p>

<p class="chorus">Do-do-do-do-do-do-do<br>
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do<br>
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do<br>
Do good!</p>
