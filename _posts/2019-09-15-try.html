<p>I’ve got to<br>
  Try to stay humble<br>
  ‘Coz Pride is rough and tumble<br>
  Power needs no chasing<br>
  When I love people over the praising</p>

<p class="chorus">My friend, remind me every day<br>
  Of all the things I’m doing okay<br>
  And of all of me that needs to leave</p>

<p>I’ve got to<br>
  Try to stay humble<br>
  Pride is rough and tum-tum-tum-tum tumble, yeah!</p>

<p class="chorus">My friend, remind me every day<br>
  Of all the things I’m doing OK<br>
  And of all of me that needs to leave</p>

<p>Honestly, it worries me<br>
  How simple words can often<br>
  Give me such a smug and swollen head<br>
  On the contrary, a part of me<br>
  Loves all of the attention<br>
  There's a crazy dance on in my head, haha!</p>

<p class="chorus">My friend, remind me every day<br>
  Of all the things I’m doing OK<br>
  And of all of me that needs to leave...</p>

<p>I've gotta try to stay humble<br>
  This pride is a tumble-tumble thing<br>
  Ummhmm, yeah<br>
  All I've ever got to do is try</p>
