title: Why So Serious?!
description: Why So Serious?! is a light-hearted take on what it's like to attempt to say sorry when a person you love is giving you a cold shoulder. Give them a hard time about it! :)

<p>Babe, I'm sorry<br>
  I should have never said those things to you<br>
  Now do you<br>
  want to stay beside me?<br>
  Let me just convey my point of view<br>
  I'll take 2, babe</p>

<p class="italic">But, why so serious?<br>
  That look is quite insidious<br>
  Tell me, is this a silent coup?</p>

<p class="chorus">'Coz I don't think tI've ever seen<br>
  A silence-wielding drama queen<br>
  Who has won as many silent wars as you!</p>

<p>I tossed and turned from night 'til morning<br>
  Rehearsing what I'd say to you<br>
  Flowers, chocolates and a movie?<br>
  Babe, 'Transporter 2'?!<br>
  But, you won't let me off so easily...<br>
  A stab of pain won't do<br>
  No, please, not that again<br>
  I can't not go...<br>
  it's 'boys night' with my crew</p>

<p class="italic">Baby, why so serious?<br>
  That look is quite insidious<br>
  Tell me, is this a silent coup?</p>

<p class="chorus">'Coz I don't think tI've ever seen<br>
  A silence-wielding drama queen<br>
  Who has won as many silent wars as you!</p>

<p>Unsuccessful dialogue<br>
  Stutter-stammer monologue
  Please f-f-forgive me<br>
  Say you love me out aloud<br>
  Silver lining on this cloud<br>
  Ease this storm within me</p>

<p>Oh no<br>
  Unsuccessful dialogue<br>
  Stutter-stammer monologue<br>
  Please forgive me<br>
  Say you love me<br>
  Say it out aloud<br>
  Silver lining on this cloud<br>
  Won't you, baby?</p>

<p class="italic">Why so serious?<br>
  Oh, girl, is this is a silent coup?</p>

<p class="chorus">'Coz I don't think there's ever been<br>
  A silence-wielding drama queen<br>
  Who has won as many silent wars as you!</p>

<p>Puhp-puhp-pah-duhp<br>
  ...</p>

  <p>Why so serious?!<br>
  That look's insidious<br>
  Oh girl, is this a silent coup?<br>
  Oh, babe, is this a silent coup?</p>
