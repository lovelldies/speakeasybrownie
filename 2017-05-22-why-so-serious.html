title: Why So Serious?

Babe, I'm sorry
I should have never said those things to you
Now do you
want to stay beside me?
Let me just convey my point of view
I'll take 2, babe

But, why so serious?
That look is quite insidious
Tell me, is this a silent coup?

'Coz I don't think there's ever been
A silence-wielding drama queen
Who has won as many silent wars as you!

I tossed and turned from night 'til morning
Rehearsing what I'd say to you
Flowers, chocolates and a movie?
Babe, 'Transporter 2'?!
But, you won't let me off so easily...
A stab of pain won't do
No, please, not that again
I can't not go...
it's 'boys night' with my crew

Baby, why so serious?
That look is quite insidious
Tell me, is this a silent coup?

'Coz I don't think there's ever been
A silence-wielding drama queen
Who has won as many silent wars as you!

Blinded by your anger-fog
Stutter-stammer monologue
Please f-f-forgive me.
Say you love me out aloud
Silver lining on this cloud
Ease this storm within me

Yeah, I'm blinded
By your anger-fog
Stutter-stammer monologue
Please forgive me
Say you love me
Say it out aloud
Silver lining on this cloud
Won't you, baby?

Baby, why so serious?
Oh, girl, is this is a silent coup?

'Coz I don't think there's ever been
A silence-wielding drama queen
Who has won as many silent wars as you!
